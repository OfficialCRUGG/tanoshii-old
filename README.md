# Tanoshii 楽しい
### Many awesome fun commands.
**This bot is still in development**

## Introduction
Tanoshi 楽しい is an open source bot which will contain lots of features. It is still in development though, so it doesn't have that many features.

## Todo
Theese things are confirmed and will be part of the bot soon:
* Moderation commands
	* Tanoshii is going to feature lots of moderation commands which would include ban, kick, softban, unban, mute, unmute, purge & much more.
* Fun commands
	* The bot will have fun commands like "mcachievement", "randommeme" and commands for specific subreddits like "woosh" & "entitledparents"
* Economy system
	* We'll also have an economy system. More information about that will be revealed in the future.
* Experience system
	* The experience system will give you XP for chatting. You can use that to unlock specific backgrounds for your profile (see next item on todo list)
* Profile
	* The bot will feature a highly customizeable profile which would show your avatar, a description, badges and one of many backgrounds.
**And much more...**
